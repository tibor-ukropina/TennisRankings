In this project I used Angular 14 to create a dynamic table which displays the top ranked players from mens ATP singles tennis. 
I used the Angular CLI to create a service which passes data from the service into the constructor of the players component. 
This table may automatically update based on the data which is stored in the hard-coded array of objects.
